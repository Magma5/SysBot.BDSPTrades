# SysBot.BDSPTrades
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-AGPLv3-blue.svg)

An extremely stripped down version of SysBot.NET for trading in Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl.
A port of my js code in a way that made sense to me due to how different these games are to Sword/Shield. Has some of the features of my fork of SysBot.NET/Web, such as special requests.

Uses [Discord.Net](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net) , [TwitchLib](https://github.com/TwitchLib/TwitchLib) and [StreamingClientLibary](https://github.com/SaviorXTanren/StreamingClientLibrary) as a dependency via Nuget.

## Other Dependencies
Pokémon API logic is provided by [PKHeX](https://github.com/kwsch/PKHeX/), and template generation is provided by [AutoMod](https://github.com/architdate/PKHeX-Plugins/).
